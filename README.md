## Disclaimers

- **This is an inofficial, unsupported launcher created for nostalgic reasons.**

- **All content is property of ArenaNet / NCSOFT.**
- **There will be no support if things break at any point.**

## Downloads

See the [releases page](https://github.com/queicherius/gw2-beta-launcher/releases/latest) for the latest Windows (32 bit / 64 bit) and Mac OS X build.

## FAQ

**How?!**<br>
This is just a pretty webpage running as a dektop application using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), which runs the official launcher in the background.

**Is this bannable?**<br>
No, it only uses the [official command line arguments](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments)

**Is my password safe when the client remembers it?**<br>
Yes, it's about as safe as remembering it in the official client. It's never sent over the wire. It is saved using AES 256 CTR with a salt that refreshes every time you log in.

**Where are the options stored?**<br>
`%APPDATA%/Guild Wars 2 Unofficial Beta Launcher/config.json` on Windows<br>
`~/Library/Application Support/Guild Wars 2 Unofficial Beta Launcher/config.json` on macOS

**My game freezes and shows a black / white screen!**<br>
This means your account credentials were not correct.

**Can you add _______?**<br>
**Something doesn't work! Can you fix it?**<br>
No. I don't have the time to maintain this project. Feel free to send in pull requests, or use the more powerful [GW2 Launchbuddy](https://github.com/TheCheatsrichter/Gw2_Launchbuddy). This project is mainly for fun / nostalgica, with no support intended.

## Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/queicherius/gw2-beta-launcher

> **Note:** When changing the background video, make sure it is as small as possible, e.g. using ffmpeg: `ffmpeg.exe -i background.mp4 -b:v 1000k -r 30 background.mp4`
